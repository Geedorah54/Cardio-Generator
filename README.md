# Hello my name is Jordan, and I'm a competitive Powerlifter
### The stereotype of Powerlifters is that they skip cardio...
### For me, that is TRUE more often than I'd like to admit
### The main reason is that it's so boring!
### The goal of this project is to give me cardio workouts randomly, to keep my workouts interesting!# Cardio-Generator
